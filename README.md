# shape-effects
A web app exposing ML models for pore sensitivity. Currently in development and many of the "full features" are available only to researchers with provided login credentials.

## See the Project
The project is currently hosted at [https://alexcasey.pythonanywhere.com/](https://alexcasey.pythonanywhere.com/). Note that the server may take a couple of minutes to load as it spins up the machine learned models before serving the page (to be fixed soon).
